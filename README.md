# AI-based Virtual Mouse

This project demonstrates how to use hand tracking to control the mouse pointer and perform double-click actions using a webcam. The application utilizes `OpenCV` for video capture, `MediaPipe` for hand landmark detection, and `PyAutoGUI` for controlling the mouse.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`
- `pyautogui`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
